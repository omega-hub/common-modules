common-modules
=========

A set of useful modules typically installed with omegalib.
If you have the omegalib maintenance script installed, get a fresh copy of omegalib with these modles typing:
```
>omega get master common-modules
```

This is an empty meta-module, used as a quick way to install several concrete modules
(see `CMakeLists.txt` for a list of modules installed with this bundle)
